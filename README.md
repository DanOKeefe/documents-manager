# ðŸ“„ Documents Manager ðŸ“š

This project is a document management app that allows users to view and upload PDF documents. It uses Streamlit for the web interface, AWS S3 for document storage, DynamoDB for metadata storage, and a transformer model for summarizing the documents.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Steps

1. Clone the repository.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/DanOKeefe/documents-manager
```

2. Install the required Python packages using pip:

```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up your AWS credentials in the ```.env``` file. You will need to provide the following:

```sh
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your_access_key"
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your_secret_access_key"
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="your_region"
```

4. Set the ```HF_MODEL``` environment variable in the .env file to the model you want to use for text summarization, for example:

```sh
HF_MODEL="Falconsai/text_summarization"
```

5. Set the ```S3_BUCKET``` environment variable in the ```.env``` file to the name of your S3 bucket:

```sh
S3_BUCKET="your_bucket_name"
```

### ðŸ“‘ How to Use
